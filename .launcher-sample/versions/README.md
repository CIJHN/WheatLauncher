This dir contains all the downloaded minecraft versions.

In other word, version downloader should point to this dir for their download task.

There may be something like VersionRepository or VersionManager, manage this directory.
And the manager should manage the runtime version files forwarding (to runtime directory).

Well, it's still in dev phase, all of above may change.
